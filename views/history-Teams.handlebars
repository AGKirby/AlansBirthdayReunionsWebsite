<h2>Alan's Birthday X:</h2>
<p>Alan's Birthday X was the first year to feature a formal, separate team event.
    To determine teams, we had four captains -- Adam, Brent, Harrison, and McLean -- who each 
    drafted their teams, resulting in the following teams: 
    <ul>
        <li>Team Adam, Noah, and Robert</li>
        <li>Team Brent, Dakota, and Dane (Basketball to Pokemon Unite) / Chris (Magic & Smash)</li>
        <li>Team Harrison, Alan, and Nat</li>
        <li>Team McLean, Jack, and Nelson</li>
    </ul>
    As for points, 1st got 4 points, 2nd got 2, and 3rd got 1.<br>Here are the results of the Team Event:</p>
