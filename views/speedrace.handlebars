<h2>What is Speedrace Fortnightly?</h2>
<p>
    Every other fortnight, we pick a random video game that none of us have played before, has a time to beat (casually) of ~2 hours or less, and that we are all able to play (perhaps on a reasonably good online emulator). There would be three phases to the competition: 
    <ul>
        <li><b>Phase 1:</b> First, at the very beginning of the fortnight's competition (typically on the Sunday), we would have 1-3 hour Discord calls where we each race to beat the game (Any%) first (having never played the game before of course). We will be split into multiple pools that each do their race at separate times due to scheduling concerns. Times and strategies discovered must be kept secret from the subsequent pools, so that they do not gain an unfair advantage. There will be no using strategy guides, watching videos, reading about the game before or during phase 1, nor may you play the game before phase 1 begins! (Here we would also make sure that we were all able to actual play the game before the competition begins, that way everyone can compete and it is reasonably fair). The top 3 overall, regardless of pool, each get points. </li>
        <li><b>Phase 2:</b> Next, starting at 12AM the day after the last pool finishes (typically the Monday), we each individually learn strategies, experiment with the game, and perform runs of the game. Any resource is fair game except talking to people in the speedrunning community! All runs have to be recorded and personal bests have to be posted on our individual YouTube channels, submitted to Speedrun.com and announced on Discord within one hour of completion (That run is nullified if not announced on Discord within 1 hour and no more runs can be done until that video has started the process of being uploaded to YouTube).</li>
        At midnight at the end of the fortnight (typically the midnight between the following Friday and Saturday), points will be awarded to the top 3 in each category. Points for that category are doubled if you get the World Record. (Individual levels and category extensions are not included). Note that any given speedrun can only be counted for one category. </li>
        <li><b>Phase 3:</b> Lastly, on the last day of the competition (typically the Saturday), we would have another video call where we would do a race of the “main” category (probably Any%) for the game. We will be split into multiple pools again that each do their race at separate times due to scheduling concerns. Times and strategies used must be kept secret from the subsequent pools, so that they do not gain an unfair advantage. The top 3 overall, regardless of pool, each get points. Then whoever has the most points overall wins the competition.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>We will have a running life-time point total for all competitions, which can be viewed in the “cumulative-standings” channel. 
    We may also mix up the earlier rules, such as by doing games we’ve all played or doing longer games and extending or shortening the two week-long time period. 
    It may also be fun to post a compilation video of the week's competition on the Alan's Birthday Ultimate YouTube channel. Which would mean that we would each have to record our phase 1 and phase 3 races.
